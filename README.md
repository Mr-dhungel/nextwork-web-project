## Introduction
This project serves as an introduction to creating and deploying a Java-based web app using AWS, with a focus on their CI/CD tools.

The deployment pipeline built around this Java web app automates software release processes, creating an efficient workflow that's invisible to end-users but crucial for development.

## Technologies
Here's what I'm using for this project:

- **Amazon EC2**: Developing my web app on Amazon EC2 virtual servers enables cloud-based software development and deployment.
- **VSCode**: My IDE of choice, connecting directly to my development EC2 instance for seamless cloud-based editing.
- **GitHub**: All web app code is version-controlled and stored in this GitHub repository.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeArtifact**: Will store artifacts and dependencies, improving availability and build speed.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeBuild**: Will automate source code compilation, testing, and software packaging.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeDeploy**: Will automate deployment across EC2 instances.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodePipeline**: Will integrate the entire workflow from GitHub to deployment.
